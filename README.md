# Setup notes

Running off of some templates.
- https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog: typescript, mdx, next, good starting base to adapt from.
- https://github.com/statichunt/hydrogen-nextjs - was originally basing off of this, but bounced after seeing ChangoMan's ts starter.

## Dependency notes
- [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) - abstraction for themes; convenient dark-mode support. Used in `_app.tsx`.
